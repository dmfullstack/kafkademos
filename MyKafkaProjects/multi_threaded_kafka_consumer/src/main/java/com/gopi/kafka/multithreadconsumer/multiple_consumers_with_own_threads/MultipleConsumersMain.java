/**
 * Gopinathan Munappy
 *
 * Multi-threaded Apache Kafka consumer model
 *
 * There are 2 possible models Iâ€™d like to mention in this post.
 *
 *     Multiple consumers with their own threads (Model #1)
 *     Single consumer, multiple worker processing threads (Model #2)
 * * Both of them have their own pros and cons
 *  Model #1. Multiple consumers with their own threads
 *  Model #2. Single consumer, multiple worker processing threads
 *
 * Model #1. Multiple consumers with their own thread
 *
 * Usage: user@user-Lenovo-G400:~/MyKafkaProjects/multi_threaded_kafka_consumer$ java -jar
 * multi_threaded_kafka_consumer_jar/multi_threaded_kafka_consumer.jar2
 * com.gopi.kafka.multithreadconsumer.multiple_consumers_with_own_threads.MultipleConsumersMain
 * llocalhost:9092 group1 multipleconsumers
