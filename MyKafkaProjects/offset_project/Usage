Create a topic named group-test with two partitions: 
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 â€“partitions 2 â€“topic group-test
    
Start a producer that could be used for publishing messages to the group-test topic that you just created: 
java -jar offset-project-producer.jar group-test

Start three consumers that listen for messages published to the group-test topic. Use group1 for the value of your group id. This will give you three consumers in mygroup: 
java -jar offset-project-consumer.jar group-test mygroup

Start a fourth consumer, but this time change the value of the group id to yourgroup. 
This will give you three consumers in group1 and a single consumer in yourgroup: 
java -jar offset-project-consumer.jar group-test yourgroup

Return to the producer console and start typing messages. Every new message you publish should appear once in the yourgroup consumer window and once in one of the three group1 consumer windows, as shown in Figure 3.
